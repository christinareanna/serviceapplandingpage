# The Service App

Pause is an example of what it could possibly look like for my idea of a website & app that is made just for service workers (& those in the service industry) to get to know one another. This is just the beginning and I'll be adding to the functionality as I think through it. It will be fully responsive & the goal is to get it into the app store by the end of 2023. You'll be able to create an account, message other people, and see events that are going on near you. An example of an event could be wine tasting, coffee tasting, or even certain classes that are exclusive to members on this website.
